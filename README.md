## How to Play
Select a move by clicking one of the buttons with the hand emojis. This will play one round. The computer generates a move and compares with the move you choose. Results are displayed to show who beat the other and who won.

## Development Process
1. I started out by making the easy version of the game that is played from the browser console. This only involves coding the basic game logic.
2. After I got the game to work, I designed a user interface and sketched the layout on paper, including buttons, displays, colors, and other elements.
3. Then I built the UI based off of my design and added DOM methods for showing content on the page. Along the way, I had to refactor the existing logic to work with the DOM instead of the console.
